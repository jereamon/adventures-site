    <p>I wasn't sure what to expect with Olympic National Park. Well, that's not completely
      true. I do my research. But it seemed like such an obscure notion to combine
      rainforest, jagged crumbling mountains, and rugged remote coastline all in
      one park.

      <p>After a couple of soggy days disc golfing in the rain my stay in/near the park
        began at Lake Cushman. Located on the East side of the Olympic peninsula
        this massive lake is nestled in amongst Mt.Ellinor, Mt.Washington, and Copper
        Mountain.
      </p>
      <p>The weather was still a little gray. A lot gray. Too gray for pretty landscape
        photos so I took photos of my less than pretty face. But as you can see.
        There's a wonderful body of water right behind my body.

        next day was a transition from the East side of the park to the West. I played
        the wonderful Shelton Springs disc golf course a couple of times and drove
        over to Lake Quinault.

      <p>I spent some time in and around the Lake Quinault Lodge and walked the nearby
        nature trails. Being a nature trail, there were helpful signs along the way
        informing me of the way the plants and animals interact.
      </p>
      <p>I'm not here to educate though. I merely provide some pretty pictures and minor
        locational details. If you want to learn about the Quinault Rainforest head
        out there and read all the signs for yourself.

    <p>Kalaloch beach. My final stop on this trip. I still don't know how to pronounce
