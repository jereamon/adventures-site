      <p>I knew I had been to Leavenworth before. At some point. Maybe. But I had no
        idea the string of lakes known as the enchantments and the staggering granite
        peaks surrounding them existed at all. This revelation led me to quickly
        plan a trip to at least skim the surface of the extensive Alpine Lakes Wilderness.
      </p>
      <p> I began my trip with a visit to the grandparents in Cle Elum and from there
        to Johnny Creek Campground. Merely twelve miles from Leavenworth this campground
        puts you in an excellent position for an early drive to the Stewart/Colchuck
        Lakes trailhead.

      <p>My first hike turned into a larger adventure than I had originally planned.
        Fortunately I started early and brought plenty of food, water, and advil.
        I found myself at Colchuck lake just before sunrise.

      <p>my plan was to hike into Colchuck and Stewart lake but when I arrived at Colchuck
        and found myself confronted by Aasgard Pass I knew I couldn't leave without
        attempting to climb it.
      </p>
      <p>Aasgard pass is the low spot on the far left in this photo, with Dragontail
        Peak just to the right of it. I didn't realize at the time that it's around
        2000 feet of elevation gain in a little under three quarters of a mile.

    <p>The way up the pass was tough, but mitigated by the fact that there were friendly
      mountain goats to guide the way. At the top I found them butting horns and
      casually laying in the snow as they shed their winter coat.

      <p>Of course getting to the top of Aasgard Pass wasn't quite enough for me and
        I soon found myself trekking further up a nearby hill that looked mellow
        compared to the nearby jagged peaks. I made my way up to a wonderful flat
        area and took in the view.

      <p>What looks like a small body of water from this vantage had taken me close
        to 40 minutes to hike around that morning. Now I had 2000 vertical feet to
        lose to get to it plus about four miles of trail to the car once I'd circled
        the lake.

      <p>Well a couple hours later, at least I was down the pass. And as I looked back
        up towards it's top I couldn't help but think it looked drastically different
        than when I had first laid eyes upon it that morning.
      </p>
      <p>To my painful inflamed knees it looked inexorably tall, an unreachable summit.
        But to the little part of my brain that never thought I would make it up
        in the first place it looked like a surmountable challenge. One I'd accomplished
        and planned to again already.

      I live close and will be back soon.
