        <p>This trip was an excuse to watch a disc golf tournament and play a legendary
          course. Along the way I played 24 different courses, did some hiking, and
          made a tentative friendship with a herd of elk.

      <p>Now, I live in Washington. So of course this trip didn't take place solely
        in California and I discovered some of my favorite disc golf courses are
        actually quite close to home.
      </p>
      <p>My first stop was Wheatland disc golf course. Just north of Salem and right
        in the Willamette River flood plain. Fortunately the course happened to be
        in great condition. All dried out, recently mowed and ready to play.

      <p>Having taken highway 199 from Grant's Pass I quickly found myself in big tree
        territory. As much as I love redwoods I can't help but be a little disappointed
        by how few long hikes there are.
      </p>
      <p>I'm not sure if I just don't know about them or if it's an indication of how
        few are left. There are still plenty of groves to explore and the Smith River
        has some great beaches.

      <p class='under-gallery-text'>So I had a good time wandering around the redwoods and played some fun courses
        along the way. You might be wondering where the photos of those courses are.
        The sad truth is I don't take photos while I'm disc golfing. It's a bad habit
        but one I haven't broken yet. Someday...
      </p>
      <p>Eventually though I made it to San Francisco and did some exploring in Golden
        Gate Park.
